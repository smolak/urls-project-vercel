# TODOs

 - [] Add global salt and per user salt for passwords
 - [] Add callbackUrl validation against malicious URLs (only in domain allowed OR paths)
   - [] Perhaps a path can be set rather than a URL?
 - [] Add email verification
 - [] Password strength validation
   - [] Password strength validation visualisation (weak, strong, very strong ...)
 - [] Perhaps addMany handling in generateModelId middleware would be needed

# Ideas

1. See if I can bring back path aliases I had in tsconfig.json which I had to remove as the ts-node (used for running seed.ts) did not understand those aliases, as if it did not use the tsconfig.json configuration. Possible solution is to double that configuration part both in tsconfig.json and package.json OR see what Google has to say about that.
1. What to do when I already have a URL on my list? Should I add it again? I guess Yes.
